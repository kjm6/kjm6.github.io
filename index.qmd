::: {#hero-heading}


I am a PhD student at University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

My research focus is on microplastic release from tire and brake wear. I study the chemical makeup and transformations
of aerosolized roadwear particulate matter and aim to identify the toxicological impact of roadwear particulate inhalation.
